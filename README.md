# MyMovies
The MyMovies app was created for my Mobile App Projects class as the final project. In this app, you'll be able to create an account to
help store data for your favorite movies. Currently, you can search for movies, tv series, and games through the search function and by
clicking on the title or poster, be able to view more detailed information about the app. In addition, there is a favorites tab that,
once loaded, allows you to see up-to-date information about your favorite movies, tv series, and video games as you add and remove them
from your list.
